@article{Burbank2006,
abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are considered by many as fundamental to realizing the global information grid (GIG) and the vision of network-centric warfare. Indeed, a fully realized MANET would be powerful in enabling highly mobile, highly responsive, and quickly deployable tactical forces. However, significant technical challenges remain before this realization is viable. Addressing these deficiencies is a significant task that will require the invention and adoption of new technology. The goal of this article is not to declare these capabilities impossible to achieve. Rather, it is to manage the expectation of the capabilities achievable in the foreseeable future through edification on the technical difficulties standing between current technology and the desired capabilities. This article provides an overview of the military MANET problem space, describing the ideal military MANET solution. Several deficiencies are highlighted that exist between MANET technologies and the desired capability. Identified technical issues include system-level architecture, routing (both interior and exterior), management, security, and medium access control (MAC), with an emphasis on the former two areas},

@article{Conan2008,
abstract = {We propose in this work a single copy and multi-hop opportunistic routing scheme for sparse delay tolerant networks (DTNs). The scheme uses as only input the estimates of the average inter-contact times between the nodes in the network. Defined as the fixed point of a recursive process, it aims at minimizing delivery time in case of independent exponential pairwise inter-contacts. The two properties of loop-free forwarding and polynomial convergence make the scheme workable for routing in DTNs. The routing performances of the scheme are evaluated on three publicly available reference data sets. Comparisons with well known single-copy schemes, including MED and the two hop relay strategy, consistently demonstrate improvements for both delivery ratio and delay.},

Unfortunately, there are no synthetic mobility models readily available for complex warfare. By using an agent based simulation coupled with game AI, we have produced a mobility modelling tool called SWARMM (synthetic warfare mobility modeller) that produces simple and believable mobility models that more closely represent tactical military deployments.},

@article{Ibrahim2007,
abstract = {This paper addresses the delay analysis and resource consumption in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) equipped with throwboxes. Throwboxes are stationary, wireless devices that act as relays, and that are deployed to increase the connectivity between mobile nodes. Our objective is to quantify the impact of adding throwboxes on the performance of two routing protocols, namely the Multicopy Two-hop Routing protocol and the Epidemic Routing protocol, in the cases where the throwboxes are fully disconnected or mesh connected. To this end, we use a Markovian model where the successive meeting times between any pair of mobile nodes (resp. any mobile node and any throwbox) are represented by a Poisson process with intensity ?? (resp. ??). We derive closed-form expressions for the distribution of the delivery delay of a packet and for the distribution of the total number of copies of a packet that are generated, the latter metric reflecting the overhead induced by the routing protocol. These results are then compared to simulation results. Through a mean-field approach we also provide asymptotic results when the number of nodes (mobile nodes and/or throwboxes) is large. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
